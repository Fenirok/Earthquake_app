QuakeTrace is a free and open-source earthquake tracking application that uses
public data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The app allows users to view recent earthquakes worldwide or near their current
location, filter results by date, and see severity information such as magnitude,
time, and alert level.

QuakeTrace does not contain ads, trackers, or proprietary dependencies.
Location access is optional and used only to filter nearby earthquakes.
